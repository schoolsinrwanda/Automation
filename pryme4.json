"day": 81,

"day": 86,
"text": "We think control equals power. But true power is letting go of the need to control things you cannot change, like other people and the past."

"day": 99,
"text": "You are not too old. It is never too late to start. You are a late bloomer, not a dead flower. There is still time for you to grow."
},

"day": 101,

"day": 103,
"text": "The news is not designed to inform you. It is designed to keep you watching. Fear and anger are the best ways to keep people attention."
},
{
"day": 104,
"text": "You are not tired. You are uninspired. You are tired of doing things that do not matter to you, in a life that does not feel like your own."
},
{
"day": 105,

},
{
"day": 106,
"text": "People will show you who they are very quickly. The mistake is not seeing it. The bigger mistake is seeing it and hoping they will change."

"day": 110,
"text": "You are looking for a shortcut. There are no shortcuts. The only way is the long way, the hard way, the slow way. That is the only way that works."
},
{
"day": 111,
"text": "A someday is a dangerous word. It is a thief that steals your today by promising you a perfect tomorrow that will never come."
},
{
"day": 112,
"text": "We are afraid of being seen for who we really are, because we believe that if they see the real us, they will leave. But the right people will stay."

"day": 118,
"text": "The truth will set you free, but first it will make you very angry. It will make you angry at yourself for not seeing it sooner."
},
{
"day": 119,
"text": "People do not want to hear the truth. They want to hear a story that confirms what they already believe. The truth is often very lonely."
},
{
"day": 120,
"text": "You are waiting for someone to give you permission. You are an adult now. You do not need permission. You can give yourself permission to do what you need to do."
},

"day": 121,
"text": "We think that if we ignore a problem, it will go away. But problems are like plants. If you ignore them, they just grow bigger and stronger."

},
{
"day": 125,
"text": "We think we need a big purpose. But your purpose can be very small. It can be to be kind, to do good work, and to leave things a little better than you found them."
},

"day": 126,
"text": "You are not the same person you were five years ago, and you will not be the same person in five years. You are allowed to change and grow."

"day": 131,

"text": "You are not lazy. You are just protecting your energy because you are using it for things that do not give you any energy back."
},

"day": 139,

"text": "You are not looking for a partner. You are looking for a teammate. Someone who will build with you, not just live with you."
},

"day": 144,
"text": "A clear no is kinder than a weak maybe. A weak maybe gives people false hope and wastes their time and your time."
},

"day": 145,
